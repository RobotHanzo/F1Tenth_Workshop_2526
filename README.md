# Notes for Hackathon
#### We have provided a template for gap finder under `f1tenth_simulator/gap_finder_template.py` as a foundation for you to build your algorithm

#### We have included the race tracks that will be used for final evaluation. Do follow the steps below to rebuild your container to get the latest changes. (Windows users should do this in WSL)
``` bash
cd ~/F1Tenth_Workshop_2526
git pull # pull the changes
```
Once completed, repeat the `Docker Setup` step in the installation guide below.


# ROS2_Workshop
  
# Installation

## Windows

1. [Install docker](https://desktop.docker.com/win/main/amd64/Docker%20Desktop%20Installer.exe)
3. **After docker is installed**, install WSL by launching Windows Powershell as **administrator** and running the following command
   
    ```powershell
    wsl --install
    ```
    
4. Enable Ubuntu in Docker Desktop settings
    - Navigate to settings in Docker Desktop
    - Under Resources > WSL integration
    - Enable the Ubuntu option then click "Apply and Restart"
  
5. After it's done installing run the following commands to start WSL

   ```powershell
   wsl --set-default Ubuntu
   wsl ~
   ```
6. Clone this repository
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/NTU-Autonomous-Racing-Team/F1Tenth_Workshop_2526.git ~/F1Tenth_Workshop_2526/
   ```
   > If you can't copy paste, right click powershell then navigate to `Properties > Tick "Use Ctrl+Shift+C/V as copy paste`"
8. Docker Setup
    - Setting up docker container
      
      ```sh
      cd ~/F1Tenth_Workshop_2526/install_windows/
      sudo docker network create f1tenth_net
      sudo docker build -t f1tenth_gym_ros .
      ```

    - Run this script to start the docker container
      ```sh
      sudo ./run_docker_container_win.sh
      ```
      
## MacOS

### **If you have homebrew installed already, you can skip to installing git**
   - Make sure xcode-select is installed by launching a terminal and running this command
     ```sh
     xcode-select --install
     ```
     > If it is installed you will see this in your terminal
     >
     > `xcode-select: note: Command line tools are already installed. Use "Software Update" in System Settings or the softwareupdate command line interface to install updates`
     > 
     > This step will take some time if you don't have xcode installed
   - Install Homebrew
     ```sh
     /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
     ```
   - Install git
   
     ```sh
     brew install git
     ```
   - [Install docker](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/mac-install/)
2.  Clone this repository
   
     ```sh
     git clone https://github.com/NTU-Autonomous-Racing-Team/F1Tenth_Workshop_2526.git ~/F1Tenth_Workshop_2526/
     ```
3. Launch Docker
4. Docker Setup
    - Setting up docker containers
      ```sh
      cd ~/F1Tenth_Workshop_2526/install_macos/
      docker compose -p f1tenth_gym_ros up -d
      ```
    
    - Run this script to start the docker containers
      ```sh
      sudo ./run_docker_containers_mac.sh
      ```
    > To stop the docker containers run `sudo ./stop_docker_containers_mac.sh`
      
## Ubuntu Linux

1. [Install docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/)
2. [Add Docker into sudo group ](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/)
3. Clone this repository
   
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/NTU-Autonomous-Racing-Team/F1Tenth_Workshop_2526.git ~/F1Tenth_Workshop_2526/
    ```
    
5. Docker Setup
    - Setting up docker container      
      ```sh
      cd ~/F1Tenth_Workshop_2526/install_linux/
      sudo docker network create f1tenth_net
      sudo docker build -t f1tenth_gym_ros .
      ```

    - Run this script to start the docker container
      ```sh
      sudo ./run_docker_container.sh
      ```

# Running the simulator

In your respective terminals run 
> Windows users need to make sure they're in WSL
```sh
source /opt/ros/foxy/setup.bash
cd sim_ws
source ./install/local_setup.bash
ros2 launch f1tenth_gym_ros gym_bridge_launch.py
```
If everything is working, a window should pop up (It might take awhile for the simulation to startup when ran for the first time). For MacOS users click on this link [http://localhost:8080/vnc.html](http://localhost:8080/vnc.html) and click on connect to view the simulation.
